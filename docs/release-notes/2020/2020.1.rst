This version was released on TODO, 2020. These release notes
document the changes that have taken place in GROMACS since the
previous 2020 version, to fix known issues. It also incorporates all
fixes made in version 2019.5 and earlier, which you can find described
in the :ref:`release-notes`.

Fixes where mdrun could behave incorrectly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix fatal error with mdrun -multidir with more than 1 rank per simulation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:issue:`3296`

Fix deadlock in mdrun runs with multiple ranks and separate PME ranks
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When multiple PP ranks as well as separate PME ranks are used, mdrun could
deadlock before starting the PP-PME balancing.

:issue:`3335`

Avoid mdrun assertion failure when running with shells and update on a GPU
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A check for shells has been added in the mdrun task assignment code,
so that mdrun falls back to CPU or produces a clear error message
when attempting to run with shells and update on a GPU.

:issue:`3303`

Allow large prime factors in the mdrun MPI rank count
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The domain decomposition would refuse to run with large prime factors
in the MPI rank count even when the grid was specified by the user.

:issue:`3336`

Actually fix PME forces with FE without perturbed q/LJ
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

PME would incorrectly ignore the mesh forces on perturbed atoms when
no charges or LJ atom types were actually perturbed. Note that this
is a rather uncommon scenario.

:issue:`2640`
:issue:`3359`

Avoid deadlock when checking for missing DD interactions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When missing bonded interactions after domain decomposition were detected,
mdrun was deadlocking instead of exiting with a failure.

:issue:`3373`

Fix checkpoint restarts using Parrinello-Rahman and md-vv
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Checkpoints using Parrinello-Rahman and md-vv (only implemented in
the new modular simulator approach) could not be read.

:issue:`3377`

Avoid overzealous program abort with orientation restraints
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

It could happen that mdrun would abort on checking orientation restraints in multiple
molecules even though no restraints where applied to them.

:issue:`3375`

Add fatal error for mdrun -multidir when simulations sharing state start at different step
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When (re)starting mdrun -multidir for simulations sharing state data
(e.g., replica exchange, AWH with bias sharing or NMR ensemble averaging)
having a different initial step only caused a note to be printed, which
could lead to simulations getting out of sync. Now a fatal error is issued
in this situation.

:issue:`2440`
:issue:`3990`

Correct skewed box using modular simulator without DD
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using modular simulator without DD, it was not checked whether the box
was getting overly skewed when using pressure control.

:issue:`3383`

Fix NMR restraints using modular simulator
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using NMR restraints (distance or orientation restraints) under modular simulator
did not work as expected. All orientation restraint simulations would fail with a
segmentation fault, as would distance restraint simulations using time averaging.
All other distance restraint simulations would run correctly, but output to the
energy trajectory would only occur if it coincided with general energy writing
steps.

:issue:`3388`

Avoid integer overflow when using dispersioncorrection
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A change in the integer type storing the index meant that the value could overflow
and turn negative, leading to wrong lookup and unphysical values.

:issue:`3391`

Fix checkpoint files getting out of sync with simulations sharing data
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When simulations share data, e.g., replica exchange, AWH with bias sharing
or NMR ensemble averaging, MPI barrier have now been added before renaming
the checkpointing files to avoid that checkpoints files from the simulations
can get out of sync. Now in very unlikely cases some checkpoint files might
have temporary names, but all content will be in sync.

:issue:`2440`

Fixes for ``gmx`` tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixes that affect portability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add support for ICC NextGen
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Add support for Intel Compiler based on LLVM technology.
To compile GROMACS with this compiler use ``CXX=icpc CXXFLAGS=-qnextgen cmake``.

Miscellaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
